# Running Jest

## Watch Mode

1. Experiment with Jest watch mode's `t` key. This enables
   you to filter tests - to just run those matching a
   pattern. Type your `describe()` block's description
   here to run just those tests in that block. Verify that
   only those tests ran.


## Run all tests matching a pattern

You can perform similar filtering from the command line,
for example by running Jest with its `-t` option.

1. Run Jest from the command line, and experiment with
   executing:

    1. only those tests which match a filename pattern;
    2. only those tests which match a test name pattern.
